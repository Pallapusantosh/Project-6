             <h3>WHAT IS ECE?</h3
            Electronics and communication engineering (ECE) is a discipline of engineering that involves developing and 
            testing electronic circuits and communication devices like transmitters, receivers and integrated circuits.
            Engineers who specialise in this domain often need to utilise the principles of digital and analogue transmission and reception of signals.<br>
             This field of engineering also involves working with microprocessors, solid-state devices, satellite communication tools, circuits and electronic devices.<br>
