        <h1>*COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING*</h1>
       <p>
        Among all the other streams of Engineering, Computer Science Engineering is one of the trending subjects among the 12th board exam takers. Reason? Of course, itâ€™s the job prospect globally. However, pursuing CSE Engineering is not an intelligent idea just because others are pursuing it.
        You need to know about your capabilities before you jump to the conclusion of selecting the lucrative stream of CSE Engineering education.

When you choose the stream, you should have computer science basic knowledge and need to know all about Computer Science and Engineering so that you can be sure that you are taking up the right decision.

That is the perfect reason why today we are going to give a detailed guide about computer science engineering so that you can gain in-depth knowledge about the same.
CSE engineering comprises the basic knowledge of computer programming and networking. The computer science engineering course will give ample knowledge about the implementation, design and management of the entire information system in hardware and software aspects.

As the name suggests, computer science engineering is a study that encompasses the theory of computation and the design and implementation of computational systems. This is a course which is offered all over the globe in the best of the technical institutions and a student can do graduation as well as post-graduation degrees.
<br>
As part of the computer science and engineering programme, students learn about developing hardware and software systems for computers and gain ample knowledge of communication systems and other similar devices. This is also one of the reasons why CSE engineering graduates are best suited for robotics research.
Academic programs vary between colleges, but typically include a combination of topics in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering. Undergraduate courses usually include programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, parallel computing, embedded systems, 
algorithms design, circuit analysis and electronics, digital logic and processor design, computer graphics, scientific computing, software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization, computer simulations and games programming. CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of
 computation, numerical methods, machine learning, programming theory and paradigms.[2] Modern academic programs also cover emerging computing fields like image processing, data science, robotics, bio-inspired computing, computational biology, autonomic computing and artificial intelligence.[3] Most CSE programs require introductory mathematical
  knowledge, hence the first year of study is dominated by mathematical courses, primarily discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis, linear algebra, probability, and statistics, as well as the introduction to physics and electrical and electronic engineering.[1][4] Students usually also have the opportunity to choose one social science subject.
