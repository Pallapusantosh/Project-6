        <h1>*MECHANICAL ENGINEERING*</h1>
       <p>
        Among all the other streams of Engineering, Computer Science Engineering is one of the trending subjects among the 12th board exam takers. Reason? Of course, itâ€™s the job prospect globally. However, pursuing CSE Engineering is not an intelligent idea just because others are pursuing it.
        You need to know about your capabilities before you jump to the conclusion of selecting the lucrative stream of CSE Engineering education.

When you choose the stream, you should have computer science basic knowledge and need to know all about Computer Science and Engineering so that you can be sure that you are taking up the right decision.

That is the perfect reason why today we are going to give a detailed guide about computer science engineering so that you can gain in-depth knowledge about the same.
CSE engineering comprises the basic knowledge of computer programming and networking. The computer science engineering course will give ample knowledge about the implementation, design and management of the entire information system in hardware and software aspects.

As the name suggests, computer science engineering is a study that encompasses the theory of computation and the design and implementation of computational systems. This is a course which is offered all over the globe in the best of the technical institutions and a student can do graduation as well as post-graduation degrees.

As part of the computer science and engineering programme, students learn about developing hardware and software systems for computers and gain ample knowledge of communication systems and other similar devices. This is also one of the reasons why CSE engineering graduates are best suited for robotics research.
Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.

Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE),
 and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, motor vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.[2][3]

Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate
 advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering, civil engineering, structural engineering, electrical
 engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling of biological systems.
